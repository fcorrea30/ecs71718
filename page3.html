     <p>Hip Hop and rap are starting to be a lot more oriented towards making people feel excited and put them in a great mood instead of being mostly lyrical. This is not the worst thing, music is about how you feel if it makes you good then the music is good.</p>

    <p> I believe that Joey Bada$$ of the group Pro Era is the best artist  in our generation. In his most recent album, "All Amerikkkan Bada$$" he sings and raps about racial issues in the United States and his younger life. His flows and beats are soothing yet very energetic, Temptation is his best song, and is just a great artist in general.
